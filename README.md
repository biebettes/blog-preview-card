## My process

🏗️ The content of the page was structured using HTML. Appropriate tags and classes were defined to ensure readability and ease of styling with CSS. Instead of naming each tag individually, I used pseudo-classes like nth-of-type to enhance practice and reinforce concepts. Since the project was created from Frontend Mentor challenges, specific width sizes were defined to closely match the visual design provided.

🎨 While styling, I first focused on aligning the Blog Preview Card to the given design. Next, I applied styles to enhance the font size, weight, and family, ensuring a clean and modern look. To improve interactivity, I added active state effects, such as box-shadow, smooth transitions, and color changes, providing a polished and engaging user experience.

### Built with

📜 Semantic HTML5 markup
🎨 CSS custom properties
📐 Flexbox

### What I learned

📚 As a newbie still progressing through online courses in front-end development, I applied the @media rule and learned the syntax for using the box-shadow property.
✨ Additionally, I incorporated the <svg> element in my code for the first time, expanding my skills in vector graphics!

### Continued development

🎨 Would like to work more on using SVGs.
✍️ Make a habit of writing comment lines for better feasibility.
📖 Enhance code readability.
🔄 Combine properties wherever possible to omit code redundancy.

### Useful resources
